/**
 * State management module placeholder.
 *
 * The original `app.js` file contains all of the logic for managing
 * game state, including versioned saves, migration logic, and the
 * persistence layer.  Extracting that code into its own module
 * would make the project easier to maintain and reason about.  Due
 * to the size of the state management portion (~700 lines), it has
 * not been copied verbatim here.  Instead, this file serves as a
 * placeholder for where that code should live.  When refactoring,
 * move the contents of the `STATE MANAGEMENT` section from
 * `app.js` into this module and export the relevant variables and
 * functions.  Be sure to attach any global variables you need to
 * the `window` object so that existing parts of the application
 * continue to function as expected.

// Example of exposing the current app version.  Uncomment and
// assign the real values when porting the code.
// export const APP_VERSION = '2.2.0';
// export const GAME_VERSION = 'v0.0 — pre-alpha';

// When the full implementation is moved here, remember to call
// `window.saveState = saveState` (and similar) to expose APIs to
// other modules.
